#+title: Mini EVM calculator ðŸ¤–

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A rough small calculator built in Rust that compile the calculation to EVM bytecode and execute it.
#+END_QUOTE

** How to run

- Step 1: install Rust and Cargo on your machine

- Step 2: clone the repository

- Step 3: start the calculator
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cargo run
#+END_SRC

** How it works

1. The lexer takes in the source (i.e. calculation) and generates a vector of Tokens
2. The parser converts it to its Prefix/Polish Notation equivalent
3. The codegen compiles it EVM bytecode
4. A mini EVM then execute it and returns the remaining value on its stack
